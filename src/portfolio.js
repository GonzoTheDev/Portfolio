Notable Projects

mcrlogs.com - This was the very first project I created while working for MCR, originally it was a very basic website, the
requirement was a clocking system, when a security officer performs their patrols they would scan QR codes that had been
placed along their route, the QR code would be a link to a form on the website, they would fill out their name and any
comments they may have had if there were any issues. This form submission would then be stored in a MySQL database and
displayed in a dashboard for the managers to see along with the timestamp of the submission. The website was built using
typical web technologies, PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Boostrap Framework.

Eventually I went on to develop the system so that instead of QR codes, we used NFC tags. The tags originally had a link to a
form on the website but eventually I developed an android app called "MCR Proximity Patrol", so that the tags could be
encoded with a unique identifier and the security officer would simply log into the app and tap the NFC tags along their patrol
route without having to fill out any details. The app would log their name, timestamp and the ID of the NFC
tag in the web server database and would then display in both the managers and clients dashboards in real time. I added many features to
this project over the years and I would be glad to talk about them in more detail.

cleanroomequipment.ie - A catalogue and quote website built using Magento 2.0. I implemented several custom plugins for
this site so that it would provide quotes to customers for cleanroom equipment. This site had over 1,000 products. This site
was built for MCR Engineering, another company under the MCR Group umbrella.

mcrgroup.ie - The main business website for MCR Group. Built using Joomla and included creating some custom plugins such
as for job postings and news.`
